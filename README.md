# Deep Neural Networks

## Overview
The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to focus on optimizating deep neural networks. It includes the implementation of a multi-layer feed-forward neural network that is designed for dealing with multi-class classification tasks.

## Features
   - Implementation of a feed-forward neural network.
   - Techniques for optimizing neural network performance.
   - Visualization of training results and model metrics.

## Usage
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook in your environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook).
   - Execute the cells sequentially to see the model implementation and results.

## Prerequisites
   - Python 3.x
   - Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
   - Required libraries: numpy, matplotlib, sklearn (make sure to install these using pip or conda).

## Input
The notebook expects datasets that are suitable for multi-class classification. Ensure all data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets before use.

## Output
   - Visualizations of the training process.
   - Performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

## Notes
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the notebook to avoid runtime errors.
   - This notebook is very basic in understanding; adjust configurations and parameters for production use.
